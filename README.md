# cmd_zip_repacker
Sometimes you have a big archive, that for some reason you can't upload somewhere in one go and you want to split it, but not using standard zip functionality, because you also need to able to use each part of the zip independently. This script will do just that.
It is designed to split one archive with lots of .pdf into maximum of 6 parts using PKWARE's PKZIPC and my own [Global Functions](https://github.com/Simbiat/cmd_global_functions). But it should be possible to modify it to your liking, if needed.
